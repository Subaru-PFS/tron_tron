   The 3.5m can control the rotator in several coordinate frames. I
assume that you will always be using the "Object" coordinate system,
where (at a rotation of 0) the CCD x axis lines up with sky
east-west. See
http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/Telescopes/TCC/Commands.html#Rotate. So
DEROTOFF would be the _user-specified_ rotation w.r.t. RA/Dec. Right?

   Oh, if the rotator (or the telescope for that matter) is not
tracking in Object coordinates, should I just return something that
you will not be able to parse? In general what should I do if I cannot
give you what you want? An error message?

   What do you want for FOCUS and FOCUSCMD? We think of focus in terms
of microns at M2. One choice would be to give the user-specified
offset from nominal as FOCUSCMD and the actual offset as FOCUS. The
"actual offset" in this case is the net position of the mirror vertex
w.r.t. the M2 frame, where that position takes temperature and sag
effects into consideration.

   What do you mean by SKYTEMP? I probably can't provide it....
And TMIRAIR? We have sensors on the front and back of M1, on the truss, in
the dome air, and just outside the dome. For RELHUM, do you want
percent (e.g. 40.0) or fraction (0.40)? Temps in C, of course?

   I take it we are punting on SLITPOS for this run? Should I just lie to you?

   [ I added a REQROT command (at my end), that just returns
DEROTOFF. ]

   We don't have tip/tilt. I'm just returning 0.0 for TIX[XY] and
TIP[XY]CMD.

  Will several offsets be given rapidly? I should point out that for
various reasons we have had to significantly slow offsets down (the
motor controllers offset roughly, so we ask the higher-level TCC to
arrange for the offsets. This effectively turns offsets into slews,
which take a minimum of 6s or so to complete.) With that limitation in
mind, should offsets be limited somehow? [I'm thinking of the arrows
on the PC keyboard, and imagining you leaning on an auto-repeating
key....]
