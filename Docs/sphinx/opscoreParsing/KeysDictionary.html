<h1 id="KeyDictionaries">Key Dictionaries</h1>
<p>
This page documents the KeysDictionary class in the module <a class="source" href="/browser/repo/ops/opscore/trunk/python/opscore/protocols/keys.py">opscore.protocols.keys</a>.
</p>
<p>
A keyword dictionary collects together a set of specifications of valid keywords for use in command or reply validation. Each keyword specification takes the form of a <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Ops/Validation#Keywords">Key validator object</a> and they are combined into a named dictionary using, for example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">KeysDictionary("tcc",(1,2),
    Key('AirTemp',
        Float(units='C',strFormat='%.1f'),
        help='Temperature of the outside air. Used for refraction correction.'
    ),
    Key('AxePos',
        Float(units='deg',strFormat='%.3f',reprFormat='%.6f',invalidValues='NaN')*3,
        help='Actual mount position of azimuth, altitude and instrument rotator.'
    ),
    ...
)
</pre><p>
The initial two parameters of the KeysDictionary are the dictionary name (for reply keywords, this should be the actor's name) and the dictionary version in the form of a (major,minor) tuple.
</p>
<p>
Any change to the dictionary should be reflected in a new version number. An update to the major version number implies that the new dictionary is not backwards compatible [TODO: be precise on which changes break the schema].
</p>
<p>
The dictionary name must be lower case. This is more restrictive than just performing case-insensitive name matching and is required since dictionary names are mapped into the python module name space which is generally case sensitive. Attempting to create a dictionary with a name that is not lower case will raise a <tt>KeysDictionaryError</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Each key must have a case-insensitive unique name within the dictionary. By default, keys are registered using the corresponding keyword name:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">Key('name',...)
</pre><p>
In case variations of a single keyword name must be registered within the same dictionary (for example, if two commands use the same keyword name for different purposes), then they can be assigned case-insensitive unique dictionary names using:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">Key('name',...,unique='cmd1.name')
Key('name',...,unique='cmd2.name')
</pre><p>
Keys can be retrieved from a dictionary by name:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">kdict = KeysDictionary(...)
if 'name' in kdict:
    key = kdict['name']
</pre><p>
Note that the <tt>name</tt> used above does not need to in a canonical upper/lower-case form but that matches are case insensitive.
</p>
<h2 id="DictionaryDistribution">Dictionary Distribution</h2>
<p>
Each actor specifies its valid reply keywords and generates reply messages that are distributed to various listeners. In order to validate incoming replies, a listener needs a dictionary of the generating actor's reply keywords. The actor and listener share a single keyword dictionary that exists as a file in a standard location on the python module search path, namely in the <a class="source" href="/browser/repo/ops/actorkeys/trunk/python/actorkeys">actorkeys</a> package. The contents of this file are exactly the same as would be used inside a python program that has already imported all symbols from <a class="source" href="/browser/repo/ops/opscore/trunk/python/opscore/protocols/keys.py">opscore.protocols.keys</a> and <a class="source" href="/browser/repo/ops/opscore/trunk/python/opscore/protocols/types.py">opscore.protocols.types</a>. For example:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">KeysDictionary("tcc",
    Key('AirTemp',(1,2),
        Float(units='C',strFormat='%.1f'),
        help='Temperature of the outside air. Used for refraction correction.'
    ),
    Key('AxePos',
        Float(units='deg',strFormat='%.3f',reprFormat='%.6f',invalidValues='NaN')*3,
        help='Actual mount position of azimuth, altitude and instrument rotator.'
    ),
    ...
)
</pre><p>
The actor and listener both load this dictionary by name using:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">kdict = KeysDictionary.load("tcc")
</pre><p>
In case the filename containing the dictionary does not match the dictionary name stored within the file, a <tt>KeysDictionaryError</tt> will be raised.
</p>
<p>
Note that there is no requirement that an actor be implemented in python, as long as it provides a reply keyword dictionary in this format (which happens to be valid python). However, a listener that is not implemented in python will need to implement its own dictionary reader (which is probably more trouble than it is worth).
</p>
<h2 id="DictionaryValidationandDebugging">Dictionary Validation and Debugging</h2>
<p>
The <tt>opscore</tt> package includes two programs under <tt>bin/</tt> that are useful for checking that you have a valid dictionary and debugging dictionary problems. Running <tt>setup opscore</tt> will add these programs to your path automatically.
</p>
<p>
The first program scans the <tt>actorcore</tt> package where all dictionary files are kept and checks each one. It also connects to the running archive server to compare the dictionary versions in your local <tt>actorcore</tt> with those being used in production (according to <a class="ext-link" href="http://sdss-archiver.apo.nmsu.edu/static/data/actors.txt"><span class="icon">this snapshot</span></a> which reflects the dictionaries the archiver knew about when it was last started). You normally run this program using:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">dictionaryValidate.py
</pre><p>
By default, the production actors are obtained from the archiver server at <tt>sdss-archiver.apo.nmsu.edu</tt> but you can pass a different hostname (with optional port number) on the command line, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">dictionaryValidate.py localhost:8080
</pre><p>
In case you are running offline and just want to check the syntax of your local dictionaries, use:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">dictionaryValidate.py --offline
</pre><p>
The program lists the dictionary status of all known actors which will be one of the following:
</p>
<ul><li>has no dictionary: the archive server does not have a dictionary registered for this actor (this is normal for the <tt>auth</tt> and <tt>keys</tt> actors)
</li><li>already in use and unchanged: your local dictionary matches the production version
</li><li>X.Y replaces N.M: your local dictionary is newer than the one in production and has a larger version number
</li><li>is new: your local dictionary is for an actor that has no dictionary in production now (most dictionaries will have this status in the <tt>--offline</tt> mode)
</li><li>has invalid version: your local dictionary version is older than the one in production (normally an <tt>svn update</tt> in <tt>actorkeys</tt> will fix this, or else you made a mistake in updating the version)
</li><li>has changed and needs a version bump: your local dictionary is different from the one in production but still has the same version (you should normally increase the minor version number by one in this case)
</li></ul><p>
Note that matching is determined by a file checksum in addition to the major and minor version numbers. In case an actor has a syntax error, it will be reported, e.g.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">badly formatted keys dictionary in .../actorkeys/mcp-test.py:
 &gt;&gt; dictionary filename and name are different: mcp-test, mcp
badly formatted keys dictionary in .../actorkeys/msg.py:
 &gt;&gt; name 'key' is not defined
</pre><p>
In cases where a production dictionary is valid but is not doing what you expect for certain reply messages, you can trace how the core message parsing and validation code is handling it using:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">messageTrace.py
Enter a reply message to trace how it is handled by the core parsing and validation
code. Validation is based on the current dictionaries in the actorkeys package.
Use ^C to quit this program.
&gt; 
</pre><p>
Any messages you enter at the prompt will now be processed with verbose trace output so you can see where things are going wrong. For example, here is a successfully processed message:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">&gt; .tcc 0 tcc I TCCStatus="TTT","NNN"; TCCPos=121.000,30.000,0.000; AxePos=121.000,29.910,0.000
# Parsing...
Header: HDR(,tcc,0,tcc,I)
Keywords:
   KEY(TCCStatus)=['TTT', 'NNN']
   KEY(TCCPos)=['121.000', '30.000', '0.000']
   KEY(AxePos)=['121.000', '29.910', '0.000']
# Loading dictionary for actor "tcc"...
loaded dictionary version (3, 7)
# Validating...
found valid key {KEY(TCCStatus)=[String('TTT'), String('NNN')]}
found valid key {KEY(TCCPos)=[Float(121.0 deg), Float(30.0 deg), Float(0.0 deg)]}
found valid key {KEY(AxePos)=[Float(121.0 deg), Float(29.91 deg), Float(0.0 deg)]}
</pre><p>
In case you are cutting and pasting from a STUI log window, leave off the initial timestamp. Use control-C to quit the program.
</p>
<h2 id="DictionaryDocumentation">Dictionary Documentation</h2>
<p>
A dictionary can describe the valid keywords it contains in either plain text:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">print kdict.describe()
</pre><p>
or else in HTML format:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">print &gt;&gt; htmlfile, kdict.describeAsHTML()
</pre><p>
Here is some sample plain text output:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">Keys Dictionary for "tcc" version (1, 2)

     Keyword: AirTemp
 Description: Temperature of the outside air. Used for refraction correction.
      Values: 1

        Repeated: once
            Type: Float (float)
           Units: C

     Keyword: AxePos
 Description: Actual mount position of azimuth, altitude and instrument rotator.
      Values: 3

        Repeated: 3 times
            Type: Float (float)
           Units: deg
